"""BLOB Output Module

The BlobOutput class is used when you need to return something file-like that can't
easily (or efficiently) be converted to JSON. This is useful for returning large objects
like images, especially where an existing file-type is the obvious way to handle it.

To return a file from an action, you should declare its return type as a BlobOutput
subclass, defining the `media_type` attribute.

The output from the class should be an instance of that subclass, with data supplied
either as a `bytes` object or a file on disk. If files are used, it's your
responsibility to ensure the file is deleted after the `BlobOutput` object is
garbage-collected. Constructing it using the class methods `from_bytes` or
`from_temporary_directory` will ensure this is done for you.

Bear in mind a `tempfile` object only holds a file descriptor and is not safe for
concurrent use: action outputs may be retrieved multiple times after the action has
completed. Creating a temp folder and making a file inside it is the safest way to
deal with this.
